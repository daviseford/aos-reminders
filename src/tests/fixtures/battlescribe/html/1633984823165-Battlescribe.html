                                            The DAEMON PRINCE keeps any command traits and artefacts of power that the HERO had. If the HERO was a WIZARD, the DAEMON PRINCE is a WIZARD, can make the same number of casting, dispelling and unbinding attempts, and knows the same spells. If the HERO was your general, the DAEMON PRINCE is now your general.<br/>
