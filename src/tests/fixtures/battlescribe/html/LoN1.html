                     Several Nighthaunt abilities allow you to return slain models to a unit. When you do so, set up the models one at a time within 1" of a model from the unit they are returning to (this can be a model you returned to the unit earlier in the same phase).<br/>
                    <br/>
                    The slain models you return to a unit can only be set up withi 3" of an enemy unit if one or more models from the unit they are returning to are already within 3" of an enemy unit.
