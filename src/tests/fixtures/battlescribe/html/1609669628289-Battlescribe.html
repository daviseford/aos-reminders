                                            Designer’s Note: Many Ossiarch Bonereapers command abilities do not require a HERO to be nearby in order for you to use it. These command abilities represent orders issued by the leader of the unit. In addition, some abilities allow you to return slain models to a unit. When you do so, set up the models one at a time within 1&quot; of a model from the unit they are returning to (this can be a model returned earlier in the phase). Returning models can only be set up within 3&quot; of an enemy unit if any models from the unit they are returning to are already within 3&quot; of that enemy unit</td>
