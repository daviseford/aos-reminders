You can either choose one of the Stormhosts in the list, or choose another Stormhost you've read about or created yourself. If you choose from the list below, all units with that keyword benefit from the extra abilities listed for that Stormhost. If you choose a different Stormhost, simply pick the Stormhost that most closely matches the nature of your own Stormhost.</td>
