These command abilities represent orders issued by the leader of the unit. In addition, some abilities allow you to return slain models to a unit. When you do so, set up the models one at a time within 1" of a model from the unit they are returning to (this can be a model returned earlier in the phase). Returning models can only be set up within 3" of an enemy unit if any models from the unit they are returning to are already within 3" of that enemy unit</td>

                     You can use this command ability after you make a run roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, the run roll is treated as being a 6.

                     You can use this command ability after you make a charge roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, re-roll the charge roll.

                     You can use this command ability at the start of the battleshock phase. If you do so, pick a friendly unit that is within 6" of friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. That unit does not have to take battleshock tests in that phase.

                    <span class="bold">Soul-linked:</span>
                     This spell is soul-linked to the caster. When predatory endless spells are moved at the start of the battle round, any that are soul-linked to a caster are moved first, followed by any endless spells that are not. Soul-linked spells are always moved by the player whose army includes the caster the spell is soul-linked to. The player that won the roll-off to determine who moves an endless spell first must move all their soul-linked spells first, followed by their opponent.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You must subtract 1 from casting rolls for a WIZARD that is soul-linked to an endless spell. A caster cannot be soul-linked to more than one endless spell at the same time. If the caster is slain, then any endless spell they are soul-linked to is dispelled.
