                     You can use this command ability after you make a run roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, the run roll is treated as being a 6.

                     You can use this command ability after you make a charge roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, re-roll the charge roll.

                     You can use this command ability at the start of the battleshock phase. If you do so, pick a friendly unit that is within 6" of friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. That unit does not have to take battleshock tests in that phase.
