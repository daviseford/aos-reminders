                    <span class="bold">At the Double:</span>
                     You can use this command ability after you make a run roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, the run roll is treated as being a 6.

                    <span class="bold">Forward to Victory:</span>
                     You can use this command ability after you make a charge roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, re-roll the charge roll.

                     You can use this command ability at the start of the battleshock phase. If you do so, pick a friendly unit that is within 6" of friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. That unit does not have to take battleshock tests in that phase.

                    <span class="bold">Balewind Vortex:</span>
                     As long as the Balewind Vortex remains on the battlefield, the caster and the Balewind Vortex are treated as being a single model<br/>
                    from the caster&#8217;s army that uses the caster&#8217;s warscroll as well as the endless spells rules. It is treated as an enemy model by the opposing player&#8217;s army. A WIZARD on a Balewind Vortex cannot move. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If a WIZARD on a Balewind Vortex attempts to dispel it, the attempt is automatically successful (do not roll any dice). This uses up the additional spell that the WIZARD would have received in that hero phase, and still counts as the single attempt they can make to dispel an endless spell this hero phase, but allows them to use any remaining spell casting attempts normally. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If the WIZARD on the Balewind Vortex is slain, then the Balewind Vortex is immediately dispelled and removed from play along with the slain WIZARD. <br/>
                    <br/>
                    If a Balewind Vortex is dispelled and the WIZARD on it has not been slain, set up the WIZARD wholly within 6" of the Balewind<br/>
                    Vortex and more than 3" from any enemy models, and then remove the Balewind Vortex model from play. If it is impossible<br/>
                    to set up the WIZARD, then the WIZARD is slain.
