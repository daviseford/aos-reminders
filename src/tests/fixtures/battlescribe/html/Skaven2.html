Bubonic Blightplague: If this Great Plague manifests, pick the nearest enemy unit within 13" of the PRIEST chanting the prayer. That unit is infected with the Bubonic Blightplague. If several enemy units are equally close, you can pick which is infected. The infected unit suffers D6 mortal wounds. If the infected unit is destroyed by these mortal wounds, you can pick another enemy unit within 6" of the last model to be slain from the infected unit. The new unit is infected and suffers D3 mortal wounds. If the second unit is also destroyed, then another enemy unit within 6" of the last model to be slain suffers D3 mortal wounds, and so on until a unit is not destroyed by the disease or there are no other enemy units within 6" when a unit is destroyed. Crimsonweal Curse: If this Great Plague manifests, pick the nearest enemy unit within 13" of the PRIEST chanting the prayer. That unit is infected with the Crimsonweal Curse. If several enemy units are equally close, you can pick which is infected. The infected unit suffers 1 mortal wound. In addition, at the start of each of your hero phases, the infected unit, and each enemy unit within 1" of the infected unit, suffers 1 mortal wound. Redmaw Plague: If this Great Plague manifests, pick the nearest enemy HERO within 13" of the PRIEST chanting the prayer. That HERO is infected with the Redmaw Plague. If several enemy HEROES are equally close, you can pick which is infected. If a HERO infected with the Redmaw Plague is within 3" of any other models from its own army at the start of any combat phase, and is not within 3" of any models from your army, then you can treat that HERO as a friendly model until the end of that combat&#160;phase. The Neverplague: If this Great Plague manifests, you can re-roll prayer rolls for friendly CLANS PESTILENS PRIESTS for the rest of the battle. Undulant Scourge: If this Great Plague manifests, pick the nearest enemy unit within 13" of the PRIEST chanting the prayer, and roll 1 dice for each model in that unit. If several enemy units are equally close, you can pick which of those units to roll dice for. For each 5+ that unit suffers 1 mortal wound.</td>

                     You can use this command ability after you make a charge roll for a friendly unit that is within 6" of a friendly HERO, or 12" of a friendly HERO that is a general. If you do so, re-roll the charge roll.
