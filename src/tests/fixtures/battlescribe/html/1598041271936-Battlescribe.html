Only 1 unit can join this model in this way.  At the end of any of your movement phases, if this model is tunnelling, it can arrive on the battlefield. If it does so, set up this model anywhere on the battlefield more than 9" from any enemy models, and then set up any unit thatjoined this model wholly within 13" of this model and more than 9" from any enemy models. Then roll a dice for this model and any unit that joined it. On a 1 or 2, that unit suffers D6 mortal wounds.  Any tunnelling reserve units that fail to arrive on the battlefield before the start of your fourth movement phase are destroyed.</td>

Redmaw Plague: If this Great Plague manifests, pick the nearest enemy HERO within 13" of the PRIEST chanting the prayer. That HERO is infected with the Redmaw Plague. If several enemy HEROES are equally close, you can pick which is infected. If a HERO infected with the Redmaw Plague is within 3" of any other models from its own army at the start of any combat phase, and is not within 3" of any models from your army, then you can treat that HERO as a friendly model until the end of that combat&#160;phase.

Undulant Scourge: If this Great Plague manifests, pick the nearest enemy unit within 13" of the PRIEST chanting the prayer, and roll 1 dice for each model in that unit. If several enemy units are equally close, you can pick which of those units to roll dice for. For each 5+ that unit suffers 1 mortal wound.</td>
