Instead, it is set up when Morathi, High Oracle of Khaine uses the Monstrous Transformation or The Truth Revealed ability (pg 76). When Morathi transforms, her High Oracle of Khaine model is removed from the battlefield and her Shadow Queen model is set up on the spot where she was standing before her transformation. Morathi&#8217;s Shadow Queen model can only be set up within 3" of an enemy unit if her High Oracle of Khaine model was within 3" of that unit before her transformation. If there is insufficient room to place Morathi exactly where she was standing before her transformation, simply place the model as close as possible to that spot where there is sufficient room. If, after her Shadow Queen model has been set up, Morathi is more than 14" away from the spot where she was standing before her transformation, she cannot move in the following movement phase.  Any wounds allocated to Morathi in her High Oracle of Khaine form prior to her transformation are carried over to her Shadow Queen form and then doubled. For example, if 3 wounds had been allocated to Morathi in her High Oracle of Khaine form before she transformed, she would be set up in her Shadow Queen form with 6 wounds already allocated to her.  Note that Morathi cannot transform back to her former aspect during the battle &#8211; once in her Shadow Queen form, she stays that way for the remainder of the battle.  If Morathi was your general in her High Oracle of Khaine form, she remains your general in her Shadow Queen form but she loses the Worship Through Bloodshed command ability.  Also note that Morathi in her Shadow Queen form loses the Sorceress Supreme and Enchanted Beauty abilities that she has in her High Oracle of Khaine form (pg 76), and she can attempt to cast and unbind fewer spells in her Shadow Queen form.</td>

                                            <td>Morathi&#8217;s Shadow Queen model is not set up on the battlefield at the start of the battle. Instead, it is set up when Morathi, High Oracle of Khaine uses the Monstrous Transformation or The Truth Revealed ability (pg 76). When Morathi transforms, her High Oracle of Khaine model is removed from the battlefield and her Shadow Queen model is set up on the spot where she was standing before her transformation. Morathi&#8217;s Shadow Queen model can only be set up within 3" of an enemy unit if her High Oracle of Khaine model was within 3" of that unit before her transformation. If there is insufficient room to place Morathi exactly where she was standing before her transformation, simply place the model as close as possible to that spot where there is sufficient room. If, after her Shadow Queen model has been set up, Morathi is more than 14" away from the spot where she was standing before her transformation, she cannot move in the following movement phase.  Any wounds allocated to Morathi in her High Oracle of Khaine form prior to her transformation are carried over to her Shadow Queen form and then doubled. For example, if 3 wounds had been allocated to Morathi in her High Oracle of Khaine form before she transformed, she would be set up in her Shadow Queen form with 6 wounds already allocated to her.  Note that Morathi cannot transform back to her former aspect during the battle &#8211; once in her Shadow Queen form, she stays that way for the remainder of the battle.  If Morathi was your general in her High Oracle of Khaine form, she remains your general in her Shadow Queen form but she loses the Worship Through Bloodshed command ability.  Also note that Morathi in her Shadow Queen form loses the Sorceress Supreme and Enchanted Beauty abilities that she has in her High Oracle of Khaine form (pg 76), and she can attempt to cast and unbind fewer spells in her Shadow Queen form.</td>
