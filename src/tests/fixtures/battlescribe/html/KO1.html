Lead By Example: Friendly KHARADRON OVERLORDS units within 12" of the Admiral in the battleshock phase do not have to take battleshock tests.  Look Out For The Boss: If there is a friendly SKYFARERS unit within 1" when the Admiral suffers a wound or mortal wound, you can roll a dice. On a 5 or 6, that unit suffers a mortal wound&#160;instead.  Talk Softly, Carry A Big Hammer: Re-roll failed hit and wound rolls for the Admiral in the combat&#160;phase.</td>
