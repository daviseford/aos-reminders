These command abilities represent orders issued by the leader of the unit. In addition, some abilities allow you to return slain models to a unit. When you do so, set up the models one at a time within 1&quot; of a model from the unit they are returning to (this can be a model returned earlier in the phase). Returning models can only be set up within 3&quot; of an enemy unit if any models from the unit they are returning to are already within 3&quot; of that enemy unit</td>

                     This spell is soul-linked to the caster. When predatory endless spells are moved at the start of the battle round, any that are soul-linked to a caster are moved first, followed by any endless spells that are not. Soul-linked spells are always moved by the player whose army includes the caster the spell is soul-linked to. The player that won the roll-off to determine who moves an endless spell first must move all their soul-linked spells first, followed by their opponent.<br/>
                    <br/>
                    You must subtract 1 from casting rolls for a WIZARD that is soul-linked to an endless spell. A caster cannot be soul-linked to more than one endless spell at the same time. If the caster is slain, then any endless spell they are soul-linked to is dispelled.
