Harvesters of the Lamentiri Once per turn, at the end your movement phase, you can pick 1 friendly SYLVANETH unit with a Wounds characteristic of 5 or less that is wholly within 12\" of this unit and roll a dice.  On a 2+, you can return 1 slain model to that unit.  You cannot pick the same unit to benefit from this ability more than once per turn. Lash and Tangle If an attack made with a melee weapon by this unit scores a hit, models in the target unit cannot make pile-in moves until the end of that turn. Martial Memories Once per battle round, this unit can receive the All-out Attack or All-out Defence command without the command being issued and without a command point being spent. Musician 1 in every 3 models in this unit can be a Spiterider Hornblower.  If this unit receives the Rally command while it includes any Spiterider Hornblowers, when you roll a dice for a slain model from this unit, you can return 1 slain model to this unit on a 5+ instead of only a 6. Roused to Wrath Once per battle, if this unit is on the battlefield at the end of your movement phase, you can say it will call its allies forth. If you do so, roll a dice. On a 2+, you can summon 1 unit of 10 DRYADS and add it to your army. The summoned unit must be set up more than 9\" from all enemy units and wholly within 9\" of an overgrown terrain feature or Awakened Wyldwood in your army. Scion 1 model in this unit can be a Scion.

If it does so, remove this unit from the battlefield and set it up wholly within 6\" of a different overgrown terrain feature or Awakened Wyldwood in your army and more than 9\" from all enemy units. Standard Bearer 1 in every 3 models in this unit can be a Spiterider Banner Bearer.

The Hive Nourishes At the end of a player's hero phase, if a SYLVANETH WIZARD or SYLVANETH HERO in that player's army is within 9\" of this endless spell, that player can use 1 of the following abilities: Vital Venoms: Pick 1 friendly SYLVANETH unit wholly within 9\" of this endless spell and roll a dice.  On a 2+, add 3\" to normal moves and charge moves for that unit until the end of that turn. Shielding Swarm: Pick 1 friendly SYLVANETH unit wholly within 9\" of this endless spell, and roll a dice. On a 2+, worsen the Rend characteristic of attacks that target that unit by 1 (to a minimum of '-') until the end of that turn. Thrumming with Life At the end of each phase, if any enemy models were slain by an attack made by this unit in that phase, you can heal all wounds allocated to this unit. Verdian Crown Friendly SYLVANETH units wholly within 6\" of this unit are treated as being wholly within 6\" of an Awakened Wyldwood in your army. Warmaster If this unit is included in a Sylvaneth army, it is treated as a general even if it is not the model picked to be the army's general. Waypipes 1 in every 5 models in this unit can be a Waypiper. If this unit includes any Waypipers, at the start of your movement phase, it can walk the spirit paths instead of making a normal move.  If it does so, remove this unit from the battlefield and set it up again anywhere on the battlefield more than 9\" from all enemy units. Writhing Vines At the start of the combat phase, if this unit is within 3\" of any enemy units, you can say that this unit will either create a protective barrier or ensnare foes. If this unit creates a protective barrier, subtract 1 from hit rolls that target this unit unit the end of that phase. If this unit ensnares foes, add 1 to hit rolls for attacks made by this unit until the end of that round. Wyldwood Revenants Add 1 to casting, dispelling and unbinding rolls for this unit while it is within 9\" of any overgrown terrain features or friendly Awakened Wyldwoods. Magic Cast/Unbind Wizard[1] 1/1 Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield, Unleash Spites Wizard[2] 2/2 Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield, Aspect of the Everqueen Wizard[3] 2/2 Arcane Bolt, Mystic Shield, Unleash Swarm of Spites Spell Casting Value Range Arcane Bolt 5 12\" If successfully cast, at the start of any 1 phase before your next hero phase, you can pick 1 enemy unit within range and visible to the caster.

Mystic Shield 5 12\" If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly unit wholly within range and visible to the caster. Add 1 to save rolls for attacks that target that unit until your next hero phase. Regrowth 5 18\" If successfully cast, pick 1 friendly SYLVANETH unit wholly within range and visible to the caster. You can heal up to D6 wounds allocated to that unit. Summoning 7 15\" If successfully cast, set up 1 Spiteswarm Hive wholly within range of the caster. Only WIZARDS from the Sylvaneth faction can attempt to summon this endless spell. The Dwellers Below 7 12\" If successfully cast, pick 1 enemy unit within range and visible to the caster, and roll a number of dice equal to the number of models in that unit.

On a 1, the bearer is slain.  On a 2+ the bearer is not slain, you can heal up to D3 wounds allocated to them, and any wounds that remain to be allocated to them are negated. Command Trait Spellsinger When this general attempts to cast a spell, before making the casting roll, you can pick 1 friendly Awakened Wyldwood on the battlefield. If you do so and the spell is successfully cast and not unbound, the range, visibility and effect of that spell can be measured from 1 scenery piece that is a part of that friendly Awakened Wyldwood. Spells that summon endless spells do not benefit from this effect. Monstrous Rampage Groundshaker You can carry out this monstrous rampage with this unit instead of any other monstrous rampage you can carry out with this unit.  If you do so, pick 1 enemy unit within 3\" of this unit and roll a dice.  On a 3+, the strike-last effect applies to that enemy unit in the following combat phase. Treelord Wounds Suffered Strangleroots Sweeping Blows Massive Impaling Talons 00-06 2+ 5 2+ 07-08 3+ 4 3+ 09-10 4+ 3 4+ 11+ 5+ 2 5+ Battle Trait Keepers of the Arcane Once per turn, when you make a casting roll or unbinding roll for a friendly GNARLROOT WIZARD that is wholly within 9\" of an overgrown terrain feature of friendly Awakened Wyldwood, you can roll 3D6 instead of 2D6.  If you do so, remove 1 dice of your choice from the roll, and then use the remaining dice to determine that casting roll or unbinding roll. Places of Power After territories are determined, before faction terrain features are set up, you can pick up to 3 terrain features on the battlefield that wholly outside enemy territory.  Those terrain features are considered by you to be overgrown terrain features. At the start of your hero phase, you can heal 1 wound allocated to each friendly SYLVANETH unit that is wholly within 9\" of an overgrown terrain feature or friendly Awakened Wyldwood. Strike and Fade Once per turn, in your combat phase, immediately after a friendly SYLVANETH unit that is wholly within 9\" of an overgrown terrain feature or friendly Awakened Wyldwood has fought and slain models (if any) have been removed from play (core rules, 14.2), you can remove that unit from the battlefield and set it up again more than 9\" from all enemy units and wholly within 9\" of either a different overgrown terrain feature that is more than 3\" from all enemy units or a different friendly Awakened Wyldwood that is more than 3\" from all enemy units. The Burgeoning Friendly SYLVANETH units that did not charge in the same turn and are wholly within 9\" of an overgrown terrain feature or friendly Awakened Wyldwood have a ward of 6+. Walk the Hidden Paths Once per turn, at the end of your movement phase, you can pick 1 friendly SYLVANETH unit that is wholly within 9\" of an overgrown terrain feature or friendly Awakened Wyldwood.  If you do so, remove that unit from the battlefield and set it up again more than 9\" from all enemy units and wholly within 9\" of either a different overgrown terrain feature that is more than 3\" from all enemy units or a different friendly Awakened Wyldwood that is more than 3\" from all enemy units.
