## How to Contribute

If you want to add an army or edit an existing army, please do so! Use the `src/army/sample_army/` folder as a reference for how things are added!

In particular, you'll want to focus on `units.ts`, `artifacts.ts`, `traits.ts`, and `abilities.ts`. 

Feel free to submit a PR for any incorrect/missing rules! I am only human, and the amount of data entry needed for a single army can sometimes be overwhelming.
