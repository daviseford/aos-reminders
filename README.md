## How to Contribute

If you want to add an army or edit an existing army, please do so! Use the `src/army/sample_army/` folder as a reference for how things are added!

In particular, you'll want to focus on `units.ts`, `artifacts.ts`, `traits.ts`, and `abilities.ts`. 

Feel free to submit a PR for any incorrect/missing rules! I am only human, and the amount of data entry needed for a single army can sometimes be overwhelming.

## Pre-commit

I have set this repository up to automatically take care of some chores when you push a commit.

1. Any special punctuation characters such as `‘`, `’` `“`, and `”` are removed and replaced with `'` or `"`.
2. Any leading or trailing whitespace is removed from any `name` or `desc` entries.
3. Finally, we use `pretty-quick` to format the code according to the repository standards.
